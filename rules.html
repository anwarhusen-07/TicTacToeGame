      <h2>Objective</h2>

        row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—before your opponent does.

      <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Players:</strong> Two players take turns marking a square in a
          3x3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O".
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Starting the Game:</strong> Players can decide who goes first,
          or you can flip a coin.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Taking Turns:</strong> On each turn, a player places their
          mark in an empty square. Once a square is marked, it cannot be used
          again.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Winning:</strong> A player wins by placing three of their
          marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Draw:</strong> If all squares are filled and neither player
          has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Game End</h2>
      <p>
        The game ends when a player wins or when all squares are filled with no
        winner, resulting in a draw.
